# Real-time graph tool : Description language, Optimization and C-code generation

This software is a full-stack tool to describe, analyse and generate
the source code for a set of parallel real-time tasks that can be
modelled using *HPC dag* or  *Digraph* task models.

This software is authored and actively mainainted by **Houssam-Eddine
Zahaf**. We aknowledge the participation of *Lug Lemaitre, Damien
Amara* and *Ikram senoussaoui* for their participation in writting
